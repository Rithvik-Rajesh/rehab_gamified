- Shows relationships between smoothness, success rate, detection rate,
  sessions, and duration
- Helps understand which metrics improve together

### 📋 **KPI Dashboard** (`kpi_dashboard.png`)

- **Comprehensive overview** with 4 key visualizations:
  - Overall Performance Gauge
  - Score Progression Trend
  - Engagement Metrics Bar Chart
  - Achievement Distribution Pie Chart

### 📈 **Success Rate Trends** (`success_rate_trends.png`)
